Github repo containing Wildcat Media website.
Built using the 'twenty' template from http://html5up.net

NOTE: This site is still in it's early stages.

Known 'Bugs':
Short term:
Logo is 3-6mb, needs shurnk. Alot.
Nav bar is located a different distance from the left when scrolling down page. (minor, but annoying)
Site should be converted to being rendered with JS. (Mostly for templating new pages)
Needs content! :)
Links to FB/Twitter
FB/Twitter Feeds
Google Calendar?

Long Term:
Upgrade streaming system from adobe, hopefully to something natively supported by HTML5.


Recent Changes:
Fixed bug where player would show under NAV menu and welcome message. Captured Welcome message and Nav menu within div with id='welcome' and set welcome to 75% page width.
